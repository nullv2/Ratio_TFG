# SHOOT

The player whose operative is performing the action is the attacker. The player controlling the target is the defender.

When rolling attack/defence dice:
- Results of **6** are always **successes** and are **critical**.
- All other successes are **normal**.
- Results of **1** are always a **fail**.

## Sequence

1. **Attacker selects one** of their operative’s **ranged weapons**.

2. **Attacker rolls attack dice** – a number of D6 equal to the selected weapon’s **Atk stat**.
   - Each result that equals or beats the weapon’s **Hit stat** is retained as a **success**.
   - All other dice are discarded as **failures**.

3. **Defender rolls defence dice** – three D6.
   - Each result that equals or beats the target’s **Save stat** is a **success**.
   - Dice that don’t meet the Save stat are **fails**.

4. **Defender resolves successful defence dice**, allocating them to block successful attack dice:
   - A **normal success** can block a **normal success**.
   - **Two normal successes** can block a **critical success**.
   - A **critical success** can block a **normal or critical success**.

5. **Attacker resolves unblocked attack dice** to inflict **damage**:
   - A **normal success** deals damage equal to the weapon’s **Normal Dmg stat**.
   - A **critical success** deals damage equal to the **Critical Dmg stat**.
