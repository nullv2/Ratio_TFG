# FIGHT

The player whose operative is performing the action is the attacker. The player controlling the target is the defender.

When rolling attack dice:
- Results of **6** are always **successes** and are **critical**.
- All other successes are **normal**.
- Results of **1** are always **fails**.

## Sequence

1. **Both players select one of their melee weapons**.

2. **Both players roll attack dice**:
   - Roll a number of D6 equal to the weapon’s **Atk stat**.
   - Each result equal to or greater than the weapon’s **Hit stat** is a **success**.
   - All others are **failures**.

3. Starting with the **attacker**, players **alternate resolving their successful unblocked attack dice** (or all remaining if the opponent has none).  
   On your turn, choose to **strike** or **block**:

   - **Strike**: Inflict damage to the enemy operative:
     - A **normal success** deals damage equal to the **Normal Dmg stat**.
     - A **critical success** deals damage equal to the **Critical Dmg stat**.

   - **Block**: Use a success to block one of the opponent’s unresolved successes:
     - A **normal success** blocks a **normal success**.
     - A **critical success** blocks either a **normal** or **critical success**.
