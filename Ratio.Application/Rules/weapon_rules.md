## Accurate x
You can retain up to **x** attack dice as normal successes without rolling them.


## Balanced
You can re-roll one of your attack dice.


## Brutal
Your opponent can only block with **critical successes**.


## Ceaseless
You can re-roll any of your attack dice results of **one result** (e.g., results of 2).


## Devastating x
Each retained critical success immediately inflicts **x damage** on the operative this weapon is being used against (e.g., **Devastating 3**).  
Note: the critical success is **not discarded** and is still resolved later in the sequence.


## Hot
After an operative uses this weapon, roll one **D6**.  
If the result is **less than the weapon’s Hit stat**, inflict damage on the operative equal to the result **× 2**.  


## Lethal x+
Your successes equal to or greater than **x** are **critical successes** (e.g., **Lethal 5+**).


## Piercing x
The defender collects **x less defence dice** (e.g., **Piercing 1**).  
If the rule is **Piercing Crits x**, it only applies if you retain **any critical successes**.


## Punishing
If you retain any **critical successes**, you can retain **one fail** as a **normal success** instead of discarding it.


## Relentless
You can re-roll **any** of your attack dice.


## Rending
If you retain **any critical successes**, you can retain **one normal success** as a **critical success** instead.


## Severe
If you **don’t retain any critical successes**, you can change **one normal success** to a **critical success**.  
Any rules that take effect from retaining a critical success (e.g., **Devastating**, **Piercing Crits**) still apply.


## Shock
The first time you strike with a **critical success** in each sequence, discard **one of your opponent’s unresolved normal successes** (or one of their critical successes if there are no normal ones).
